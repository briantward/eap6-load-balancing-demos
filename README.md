# Load Balancing Strategy Demonstrations

These demonstrations are all built on EAP 6.3.0 with EWS 2.1.0 downloaded from access.redhat.com.  

## 1. Building the demo environment base:

1. Extract the EAP server.
    ```
    unzip jboss-eap-6.3.0.zip -d DEMO_FOLDER
    unzip jboss-eap-native-webserver-connectors-6.3.0-RHEL7-x86_64.zip -d DEMO_FOLDER
    mv DEMO_FOLDER/jboss-eap-6.3 DEMO_FOLDER/eap-home
    ```
2. Duplicate the number of standalone servers you need.
    ```
    mv DEMO_FOLDER/eap-home/standalone DEMO_FOLDER/eap-1
    cp -Ra DEMO_FOLDER/eap-1 DEMO_FOLDER/eap-2
    ```

3. Enable the modeler within tomcat to use the mod_cluster demo tool in part 4 below.
    
    CLI:
    ```
    /system-property=org.apache.tomcat.util.ENABLE_MODELER/:add(value=true)
    ```
    
    XML (normally added after \<extensions\>):
    ```
    <system-properties>
       <property name="org.apache.tomcat.util.ENABLE_MODELER" value="true"/>
    </system-properties>
    ```

4. Extract the Apache server. 
    ```
    unzip jboss-ews-httpd-2.1.0-RHEL7-x86_64.zip -d DEMO_FOLDER
    mv DEMO_FOLDER/jboss-ews-2.1 DEMO_FOLDER/ews-1
    cp -Ra DEMO_FOLDER/ews-1 DEMO_FOLDER/ews-2
    ```
    
5. Configure the Apache server with the included scripts.  The script will build absolute paths to resources in the configurations. Remove auth_kerb.conf if you don't plan on making use of it.
    ```
    cd DEMO_FOLDER/ews-1/httpd/
    ./.postinstall
    cd ../../ews-2/httpd/
    ./.postinstall
    cd ../../
    rm ews-1/httpd/conf.d/auth_kerb.conf
    rm ews-2/httpd/conf.d/auth_kerb.conf
    ```
6. Then extract or copy the demo files in this project overtop your completed setup.  See respective demo for configuration explanations.

## 2. Choose a Subfolder Demonstration Example
* mjk_demo - mod_jk configuration
* mc_demo - mod_cluster configured without ServerAdvertise from apache, using proxy-list in EAP to know the apache instances
* mc_demo_adv - mod_cluster configured with ServerAdvertise over UDP
* mc_demo_tcp - mod_cluster configured with jgroups TCP stack (for cache distribution)

Replace the configs in these demos with that of your server built in step 1, or review the documentation in each to do the configuration step-by-step yourself.

N.B. These demos are setup with the minimum necessary number of apache and jboss servers to demonstrate load balancing.  2 over 2 is not a specifically recommended architecture.
  
## 3. Deploy cluster example application
cluster.war is based off this repo: 
[https://github.com/akquinet/jbosscc-as7-examples]
   
## 4. Analyze with load balancing tool 
This tool was developed by the mod_cluster team, but it can be used for testing mod_jk as well.
1. Deploy the load-demo.war to the EAP instances.
2. Run the client from your local or other remote machine.  It requires a java GUI interface.

N.B. This tool will run from the host you use it on, thus any requests from it come from the same IP.  If you are sending traffic directly to a hardware-based load balancer in front of the apache software-based load balancer, then you will probably hit the same apache software-based load balancer every time.  That behavior is governed by the hardware load balancer.
